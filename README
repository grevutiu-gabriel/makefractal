makefractal is an application for creating Mandelbrot fractal using library 

libpng. Initial source code is from http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/files/libPNG/makePNG.c.
I made in time some modifications in order to fit with my requirements.

Source code is released under license GNU GPL v3.0.
